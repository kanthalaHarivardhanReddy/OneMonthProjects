<!-- Here are 7 challenges that you need to do RIGHT NOW.
These will help you learn JavaScript quicker than a fat baby sweats:

1. If you wanted to see the results of randomNumber you could print that out by adding the following code after line 38:  

document.write(randomNumber); 

When you refresh what happens? 

2. Did you notice that sometimes a 0 pops up? What's that about!? Do a quick Google Search and you'll learn that arrays always start with 0 (not 1). I just gave you that answer. Send it in as your answer and impress the hell out of your One Month Mentor. 

3. What happens when you replace bars[randomNumber] with bars[3]?

4. What does bars.length do? Print it out to see. 

5. What does Math.floor do? Remove it to find out. 

6. What is Math? No that's not a metaphysical question. Seriously, what is that word Math doing all around this code!? I challenge you to google it and come up with a good answer. Go deeper and print out some other Math methods. You can do this. And it all starts with one 6 letter word: GOOGLE. 

7. Add one friend to the list of friends. 

Bonus challenge: Remove 3 friends from the list of friends. Why does this give you an "undefined" result when you occasionally refresh? Can you fix the problem? -->
